This is a small utility app to keep track of your time. It is an ideal tool for a workplace that does not provide you with an automated way of knowing at which time you arrived and left the office.

## How does it work
You do not need to input anything related to your arrival and departure to the app. With the help of a little bit of magic, it automatically detects at which time you first unlocked your computer on a day and the last time that you locked your computer.
Based on that information, it is able to calculate how much hours you were at work. You can then adjust how many minutes you spend in pause.

## Installation
To install this app, simply [click here](https://github.com/Moustachauve/Timesheet-Hero/releases/latest) and download the most recent .exe file.
