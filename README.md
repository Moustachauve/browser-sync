# Browser Sync
This is a small utility app to compare the same page on different domains. This can be useful to compare the result of a production server against a development server.

## How does it work
You will need to set the domains of the two windows. Once this is done, the url will be syncronized between the two windows while staying on the domain they are configured to.

It is also possible to compare and edit the cookies of the two windows.
